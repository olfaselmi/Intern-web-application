# Intern Web Application

This repository hosts the front-end Angular code for the Intern Web Application developed during my internship. The application is built using the Angular framework to create a single-page application with responsive design and interactive features.

## Project Overview

The codebase is organized with a focus on modularity and maintainability. Here's a brief overview of the directory structure and key files:

- `.vscode/`: Contains configurations for Visual Studio Code.
- `src/`: The source directory where the Angular components, services, modules, and other assets are located.
- `.browserslistrc`: Configurations for target browsers compatibility.
- `.editorconfig`: Ensures consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the project.
- `.gitattributes`: Defines attributes per path in the repository.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore by Git.
- `angular.json`: CLI configuration defaults for all projects in the workspace, including configuration options for build, serve, and test tools.
- `karma.conf.js`: Configuration file for the Karma test runner.
- `package-lock.json` & `package.json`: Lists the project dependencies and locks the versions for consistent installs across environments.
- `tsconfig.*.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration files.
